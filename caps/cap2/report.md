# Executive Summary

## Approach to Testing the Website

The primary approach to solving the basic challenges on Hack This Site involves:The first way of addressing the core problems on the website Hack This Site is:

- Secondly, knowledge in layout design, structure and creation of a website using webs technologies such as HTMLs, Javascripts and essentially understanding of server side scripts. 

- The HTML stands for hypertext markup language and it is the process of viewing the HTML or source of the specific webpage in order to find messages or something that is virtually visible from the comments of the HTML code. 

- Flexibility in regulation or tuning of the application in order to determine where there may be vulnerabilities and strengths in utilization of this particular application. 

- Using simple models and effective sets of models that have typical vulnerabilities in Web applications, for example, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and unavailable access types. 

- Debugging of the client side scripts and features, tracking and determination of bug in the developed JavaScript applications. 

- Depending on the action, there are some constant and innovative measures that are taken to counter the barriers that were installed to discourage unfavorable undertakings. 

- Based on the identified features, implementing the experience obtained when solving previous cases for the same problem. 

To assess the security of Gruyere, various approaches were applied:To evaluate the enhanced security of Gruyere, several methods were utilized:

- The first type of testing is carried out manually where one goes through the code of the program and applies some controls whereby one tries to locate one or many faults which may cause a security vulnerability. 

- Identifying the exhaustive testing plan and conducting dynamic application security test on this live application called Gruyere. 

- Engineering: Permanent tools for static code analysis, dynamic analysis with Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP. 

- First, one should examine the authorization controls and access rights’ effectiveness; second, input data should be examined for validation; third, output data should be validated for encoding. 

- Defining the characteristics and features of the session management, errors handling, and logging respectively or in other words discovering the session management, errors handling, and logging systems or solutions. 

- Here, third-party components are reviewed, social engineering tests are conducted, and compliance checks are made in an endeavor to identify threats and ensure how they are going to be dealt with.

## Assessment Overview and Recommendations

Thus, in order to evaluate the level of security of the web sites 10, the systematical procedure of the research was applied. 3. 21. 141:8000, 10. 3. 21. 141:8008, 10. 3. 21. 141:8090, and www. hackthissite. org. The process included:

- Reconnaissance: Define the network and scan it.

- Manual Testing: This is why a hands on examination of the different applications is would be most appropriate.

- Exploitation: As a result of the research made in previously described steps, it is possible to determine certain weaknesses that could be the target of attacks.

- Validation: To confirm a thief’s misdeed One must first capture the culprit in the act Photographing the Raand Institite Students were no easy feat as they move too swift.

- Reporting: This involves maintaining records of results and proper recommendations that may be deemed necessary.

From the testing, they identified areas that were missed or strong in the security system and provide general suggestions that were meant to improve the general system security. Proposed remedies include: rectifying the identified weaknesses, providing security awareness to staff, performing periodic security audits, reviewing security standard settings, improving the practice on logging and monitoring,151, 152 implementing ‘proof of concept’ tests, consolidating the measures on identification and authorization, and developing the procedure for dealing with security incidents.

## Remediation Summary



- After that, it is necessary to remain strict with the control mechanisms and never put the relevant information in the HTML source code. 

- Extend the access control measures and provide the XSS allow list. 

- Now, it is time to fix the client-side validation with server-side validation. 

- Increasing the number of detailed authentication measures and Hide issues such as directory traversal and basic authentication bypass. 

- Regular input data filtering is required and the highest level of control for the directory access must be established. 

- To make the issues more tangible, the following should be implemented: They should provide security audit and training; and exercise frequent security checks to enhance compliance and data protection laws in the organization. 

For this reason, several points can be indicated which can be considered in the assessed web sites in order to increase the security and avoid real threats and risks.
